# 🩺 Covid_vaccine_heart_attack_data

This project analyzes a dataset of patients who received COVID-19 vaccinations and experienced varying health outcomes, including heart attacks. The goal is to identify patterns and potential correlations between factors such as vaccine dose, age, pre-existing conditions, BMI, smoking history, and heart attack occurrence.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes the following columns:

- `PatientID`
- `Age`
- `Gender`
- `Vaccination Date`
- `Vaccine Dose`
- `Pre-existing Conditions`
- `Heart Attack Date`
- `Severity`
- `Outcome`
- `Location`
- `Blood Pressure`
- `Cholesterol Level`
- `BMI`
- `Smoking History`
- `Diabetes Status`

## 🧠 Questions Explored

1. How many patients received each vaccine dose?
2. What percentage of patients received each vaccine dose?
3. What percentage of patients had no pre-existing conditions?
4. Is there a significant difference in average cholesterol levels between patients with and without diabetes?
5. How does BMI vary with smoking history?
6. How many patients suffered a heart attack after vaccination?
7. What is the distribution of heart attack severity by age group?
8. What are the outcomes (e.g., recovered, deceased) of patients who had heart attacks?
9. Is there a pattern between vaccine dose and heart attack occurrence?
10. What is the average cholesterol level and BMI by location?
11. How many patients have elevated or high blood pressure?
12. What is the correlation between blood pressure level and heart attack severity?
13. Among heart attack patients, how many had diabetes and/or were smokers?
14. What percentage of heart attack patients were elderly (age 60+)?
15. Are patients with both diabetes and high BMI more likely to experience severe heart attacks?
16. How does heart attack severity differ across different pre-existing conditions?

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft SQL Server** – For querying and analysis


## 📊 Insights & Observations

- The majority of patients who had heart attacks received the **booster dose**.
- Patients with **high blood pressure** or **diabetes** showed a higher likelihood of experiencing **severe heart attacks**.
- **Smoking history** appears to be linked with elevated BMI in many cases.
- There may be a **temporal relationship** between vaccination and heart attack timing in a subset of patients.
